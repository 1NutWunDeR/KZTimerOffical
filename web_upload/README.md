`You need to be using MySQL for your database for this to work.`  
This is a simple web frontend for KZ server owners to allow their clients to view stats online, rather than being listed in global stats.

### How to setup
 - Edit `dbconnect.php` with the credentials to your DB.
 - Upload files to webserver.
 - Done.

`If you would like to report bugs you can do so via a GitHub issue.`
