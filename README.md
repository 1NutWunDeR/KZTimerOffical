**About**
- Latest version: *1.84 Global* (SM-Compiler 1.7.3)
- Multi-Language support (english, chinese, french, german, russian, portuguese brazilian  and swedish)

KZTimer is a powerful climb timer plugin including local ranking system, global ranking system, replay bots, jumpstats, strafestats, failstats, anticheat-system, sourcebans support, mysql&sqlite access, custom models, prestrafe, prespeed cap, double-duck, autobhop, client options and more.


**Please read the following information carefully before you start asking stupid questions:**
- KZTimer Client/Admin Commands: http://pastebin.com/H5ULxsdJ
- Detailed explanation how the ranking system of kztimer works: http://kuala-lumpur-court-8417.pancakeapps.com/ranking_index2.html
- Make sure that you have added all maps to your mapcycle.txt. You don't get any experience points from a map which is not in this list. Keep it always up to date!
- A very large sqlite database might cause server lags (i prefer a mysql database)
- KZTimer interferes with menus of other plugins. You are able to add exceptions in addons\sourcemod\configs\kztimer\exceptions_list.txt for sourcemod commands which create menus (e.g. sm_knife)
(Example for menus which requires an internal fix: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2265536&postcount=487)
- Download includes DHooks2 extension (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=180114), Cleaner extension (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=195008)  and latest GeoIP database (http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/)
- How do I get my server whitelisted? Send an email to sooletus@gmail.com with your server's information. 

**Installation**
- 1. KZTimer requires sourcemod and metamod
- 2. Extract everything to your servers csgo folder 
- 3. Edit the file addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg 
- 4. Add in a value called "kztimer", which holds your databases information 
- 5. Both SQLite and MySQL are supported 
- 6. Example with using SQLite: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dzk4mt3jze0ek78/databasecfg.jpg 
- 7. Make sure that you have added all maps to your csgo\mapcycle.txt. You don't get any experience points from a map which is not in this list
- 8. Done.

Installation notes v1.72 if you want to upgrade kztimer from an older version: 
1) Backup your sourcemod folder and csgo/cfg/sourcemod/KZTimer.cfg
2) Make sure that your server is running sourcemod 1.7.0 or a newer version.
3) Shutdown your cs:go server
4) You have to remove all files from "csgo\addons\sourcemod\extensions" which CONTAIN "dhooks.ext.2" in their name. (Reason: KZTimer archive includes a newer dhooks version with a different file name)
5) Delete csgo/cfg/sourcemod/KZTimer.cfg
6) Extract all files from the archive to the root folder of csgo. I'd recommend to replace all files.
7) Restart your server. Done!
